### Screenshot and FTP upload script

#### About

I grew tired of not having a decent puuush alternative in Linux, so I wrote my own in a language I have never even used. 

Some code is lifted from tyru's"gyazo-linux" script, which was themain inspiration for this script. There is a link to the github ofThat script in the corresponding section.

Name was suggested to me by [@8C](http://www.twitter.com/8C) onTwitter, it seemed the funniest.

#### To Do

* SFTP support, possibly default unless switch (quite likely)
* Learn Ruby, it seems so simple (not very likely)
* Make cross-platform (extremely unlikely)

----

#### License
You are free to do whatever the hell you'd like to do with this code. If you do wish to attribute it to me, a link to http://acostoss.com will be more than enough.

To be honest, I dont see this ever happening. This thing is so simple.
